/*
This data model contains basic defintion of the image data structure I wanted. Ample scope for improving when there are dynamic images to be used.

Used images found on different blogs, apparently based on the book https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535713-soppy
Hopefully, I haven't infringed any copyrights with these images. I don't mean to use this commercially!

Future Plans:  Adding functions and manager actions to have dynamic loading of images.
